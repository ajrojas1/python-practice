## Riemann Sum Example

This folder contains practice code to find the Riemann sum within a polygon on a raster dataset, specifically a digital elevation model. This example will calculate the Riemann sum manually in Python. 

Two programs will be made. (1) The first will rely on ArcPy dependencies and will be tested on a sample dataset made using ArcGIS funtions. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/ajrojas1/python-practice/blob/master/riemann_sum/riemann_arcpy.ipynb). (2) The second program (still in progress as of 04/11/2020) will rely solely on open source Python packages. For the time being, a sample raster dataset for program (2) was created using R.

This practice problem began as one component to a final project for GEOG 592, GIS Programming, a course at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.
